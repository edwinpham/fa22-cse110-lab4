4. An error is returned since "result" is not defined. Since "result" was declared using the let keyword, "result" is only able to be used within the block that it is in, which is inside the if statement.
5. An error is returned before the code can get to line 9 since "result" is trying to be assigned a new value but can't given that "result" is declared with a const keyword. The const prevents the variable to be reassigned.
6. An error is returned before the code can get to line 13 given the previous error.
